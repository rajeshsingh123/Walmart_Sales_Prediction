# Walmart_Sales_Prediction
# Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting Walmart sales. The project utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle, involving a series of data preprocessing, exploration, and modeling steps to achieve accurate predictions.

# Project Structure
-Data Exploration:

Data preprocessing
Data checking
Data visualization
Data correlation analysis
Data Cleaning:

Identify and handle missing data
Remove outliers
Check for data integrity
Data Modeling:

Implement various machine learning models
Evaluate model performance
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal results
Data Transformation:

Normalize data for consistent modeling
Feature engineering for enhanced predictions
#Conclusions
After thorough analysis and modeling, several insights were derived:

1 Seasonal Sales Patterns:
Sales exhibit an upward trend during the summer months.
2 Holiday Impact:
Sales rates are notably higher during holidays compared to regular days.
3 Store Variance:
Significant variance exists in weekly sales figures across different stores.
4 Unemployment Rate Influence:
Sales are inversely correlated with the unemployment rate; higher unemployment corresponds to lower sales.
# Model Comparison
After experimenting with multiple machine learning models, including but not limited to Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Linear Regression, the Linear Regression Model emerged as the most accurate.

Best Model: Linear Regression
Accuracy: 96.84%
Successfully predicts weekly sales based on the dataset features.
